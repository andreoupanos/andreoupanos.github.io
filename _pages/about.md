Hi, I’m **Panos**!

I’m a PhD candidate in **Statistics** at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My research focuses on **network time series** and **high-dimensional statistics for econometrics**.

This year, I will be on the **job market for postdocs** in statistics and related fields.

Feel free to explore the tabs above or download my [CV](./cv/).
